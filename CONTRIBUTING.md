# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Mousefood!

## Reporting issues

1. Before submitting a new issue, please search the
   [issue tracker](https://github.com/ratatui/mousefood/issues) using relevant
   keywords to ensure it hasn't already been reported.

## Pull requests

1. Please include as much detail as possible in your pull request description
   and follow the provided template. Be sure to highlight any changes that may
   need special attention or that you're unsure about.
2. If your idea could significantly impact the crate or its users, it's best to
   discuss it in an issue first.
3. Try to keep each pull request focused on a single change.
4. Avoid mixing refactoring or reformatting with behavioral changes. Consider
   splitting such changes into separate PRs.
5. Run `cargo fmt` before committing.
6. Use Conventional Commits for commit messages (for example, `feat: add foo`
   or `fix: handle bar edge case`).
7. Keep PR titles concise and aligned with Conventional Commits so they are
   easy to scan (for example, `docs: update contributing`).
